Pull Requests is a great feature of GitHub

They offer an opportunity for stakeholders to review and discuss the proposed changes to ensure that the code quality in the base branch is kept as high as possible (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-changes-pull-requests-github/2-what-are-pull-requests).
